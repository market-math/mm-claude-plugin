# Plan with Review
When creating an implementation plan for any non-trivial task:
1. Draft the plan and present it
2. Immediately delegate to the `staff-engineer` subagent to review the plan
3. Incorporate the staff engineer's feedback and present the revised plan

Do NOT wait for user input between steps. The entire process should be automatic.
